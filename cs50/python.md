- type() method returns variable type
- python **-i** makes python work in interactive mode in python
    - alternatively you can do python -i [filename] for working in same nevironment
- dir(): everything in python is an object. dir gives you the properties and methods of any item
- print('Name:', end='!\n') 
- print('Name:','Dr. B', 'Year:',5)
    - instead of concatenate, separate args w/ commas
